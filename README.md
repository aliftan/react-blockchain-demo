# Blockchain Product CRUD Demo

This project demonstrates a simple blockchain-based product management system using React and a custom blockchain implementation.

## Overview

This application showcases how blockchain technology can be applied to a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing products. It visualizes the blockchain structure and allows users to interact with the blockchain through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Create, update, and delete products
- Visualize the blockchain structure
- Demonstrate blockchain tampering and validation
- Animated UI components for better user experience

## Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- react-spring for animations
- crypto-js for hashing

## How It Works

1. **Product Management**: Users can add, update, and delete products. Each action creates a new block in the blockchain.
2. **Blockchain Visualization**: The app displays each block in the chain, showing its hash, previous hash, and data.
3. **Tamper Demonstration**: Users can simulate tampering with a block to see how it affects the chain's validity.
4. **Chain Validation**: The app allows users to validate the entire blockchain, demonstrating the security aspect of blockchain technology.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Available Scripts
